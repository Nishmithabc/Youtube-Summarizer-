TF(t,d)=number of repeatation of words in sentence/total number of words in sentence
IDF(t,D)=log(no. of sentences/no. of sentences containing this word).
if term is rare across the corpus then high IDF .
TF-IDF(t,d,D)=TF(t,d) x IDF(t,D)
words in column and sentences are in the row
this helps in distinguishing the important words.
if it is unique then it has higher TF-IDF value
