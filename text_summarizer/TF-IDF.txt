TF(t,d)=number of times t appears in the document/total number of terms in document
IDF(t,D)=total number of document in corpus|D|/number of documents containing term t.
if term is rare across the corpus then high IDF 
TF-IDF(t,d,D)=TF(t,d) x IDF(t,D)
this helps in distinguishing the important words.
if it is unique then it has higher TF-IDF value
